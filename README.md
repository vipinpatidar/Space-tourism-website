# Frontend Mentor - Space tourism website

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this multi-page space tourism website and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

If you're working through it yourself, please use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

If you choose to use a JS-heavy approach, we provide a local `data.json` file for the different page data. This means you'll be able to pull the data from there instead of using the separate `.html` files.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each of the website's pages depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each page and be able to toggle between the tabs to see new information
